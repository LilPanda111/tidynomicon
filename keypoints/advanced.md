- The `reticulate` library allows R programs to access data in Python programs and vice versa.
- Use `py.whatever` to access a top-level Python variable from R.
- Use `r.whatever` to access a top-level R definition from Python.
- R is always indexed from 1 (even in Python) and Python is always indexed from 0 (even in R).
- Numbers in R are floating point by default, so use a trailing 'L' to force a value to be an integer.
- A Python script run from an R session believes it is the main script, i.e., `__name__` is `'__main__'` inside the Python script.
- S3 is the most commonly used object-oriented programming system in R.
- Every object can store metadata about itself in attributes, which are set and queried with `attr`.
- The `dim` attribute stores the dimensions of a matrix (which is physically stored as a vector).
- The `class` attribute of an object defines its class or classes (it may have several character entries).
- When `F(X, ...)` is called, and `X` has class `C`, R looks for a function called `F.C` (the `.` is just a naming convention).
- If an object has multiple classes in its `class` attribute, R looks for a corresponding method for each in turn.
- Every user defined class `C` should have functions `new_C` (to create it), `validate_C` (to validate its integrity), and `C` (to create and validate).
- Use the `DBI` package to work with relational databases.
- Use `DBI::dbConnect(...)` with database-specific parameters to connect to a specific database.
- Use `dbGetQuery(connection, "query")` to send an SQL query string to a database and get a data frame of results.
- Parameterize queries using `:name` as a placeholder in the query and `params = list(name = value)` as a third parameter to `dbGetQuery` to specify actual values.
- Use `dbFetch` in a `while` loop to page results.
- Use `dbWriteTable` to write an entire data frame to a table, and `dbExecute` to execute a single insertion statement.
- Dates... why did it have to be dates?
