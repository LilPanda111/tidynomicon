- Use `print(expression)` to print the value of a single expression.
- Variable names may include letters, digits, `.`, and `_`, but `.` should be avoided, as it sometimes has special meaning.
- R's atomic data types include logical, integer, double (also called numeric), and character.
- R stores collections in homogeneous vectors of atomic types, or in heterogeneous lists.
- 'Scalars' in R are actually vectors of length 1.
- Vectors and lists are created using the function `c(...)`.
- Vector indices from 1 to length(vector) select single elements.
- Negative indices to vectors deselect elements from the result.
- The index 0 on its own selects no elements, creating a vector or list of length 0.
- The expression `low:high` creates the vector of integers from `low` to `high` inclusive.
- Subscripting a vector with a vector of numbers selects the elements at those locations (possibly with repeats).
- Subscripting a vector with a vector of logicals selects elements where the indexing vector is `TRUE`.
- Values from short vectors (such as 'scalars') are repeated to match the lengths of longer vectors.
- The special value `NA` represents missing values, and (almost all) operations involving `NA` produce `NA`.
- The special values `NULL` represents a nonexistent vector, which is not the same as a vector of length 0.
- A list is a heterogeneous vector capable of storing values of any type (including other lists).
- Indexing with `[` returns a structure of the same type as the structure being indexed (e.g., returns a list when applied to a list).
- Indexing with `[[` strips away one level of structure (i.e., returns the indicated element without any wrapping).
- Use `list('name' = value, ...)` to name the elements of a list.
- Use either `L['name']` or `L$name` to access elements by name.
- Use back-quotes around the name with `$` notation if the name is not a legal R variable name.
- Use `matrix(values, nrow = N)` to create a matrix with `N` rows containing the given values.
- Use `m[i, j]` to get the value at the i'th row and j'th column of a matrix.
- Use `m[i,]` to get a vector containing the values in the i'th row of a matrix.
- Use `m[,j]` to get a vector containing the values in the j'th column of a matrix.
- Use `for (loop_variable in collection){ ...body... }` to create a loop.
- Use `if (expression) { ...body... } else if (expression) { ...body... } else { ...body... }` to create conditionals.
- Expression conditions must have length 1; use `any(...)` and `all(...)` to collapse logical vectors to single values.
- Use `function(...arguments...) { ...body... }` to create a function.
- Use variable <- function(...arguments...) { ...body... }` to create a function and give it a name.
- The body of a function can be a single expression or a block in curly braces.
- The last expression evaluated in a function is returned as its result.
- Use `return(expression)` to return a result early from a function.
