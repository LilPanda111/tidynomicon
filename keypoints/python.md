- The `reticulate` library allows R programs to access data in Python programs and vice versa.
- Use `py.whatever` to access a top-level Python variable from R.
- Use `r.whatever` to access a top-level R definition from Python.
- R is always indexed from 1 (even in Python) and Python is always indexed from 0 (even in R).
- Numbers in R are floating point by default, so use a trailing 'L' to force a value to be an integer.
- A Python script run from an R session believes it is the main script, i.e., `__name__` is `'__main__'` inside the Python script.
