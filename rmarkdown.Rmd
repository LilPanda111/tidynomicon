# Creating Reports {#rmarkdown}

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
source("etc/common.R")
```

Every serious scholar dreams of recording their knowledge in a leather-bound tome
that will lie forgotten and dusty on the shelves of an out-of-the-way library
at a small college with a dubious reputation
until someone naïve enough to believe that they can control forces beyond mortal ken
stumbles upon it and unleashes ravenous horrors to prey upon the sanity of the innocent.
Sadly,
in these diminished times we must settle for dry expositions of trivia
typeset in two columns using a demure font and sequentially-numbered citations.

But there is yet hope.
One of R's greatest strengths is a package called `knitr`
that translates documents written in a format called R Markdown into HTML, PDF, and e-books.
R Markdown files are a kind of programmable document;
authors can interleave prose with chunks of R (or other languages)
and `knitr` will run that code as it processes the document
to create tables and diagrams.
To aid this,
the RStudio IDE includes tools to create new documents,
insert and run code chunks,
preview documents' structure and output,
and much more.

That's the good news.
The bad news is that Markdown isn't a standard:
it's more like a set of ad hoc implementations flying in loose formation.
While basic elements like headings and links are more or less the same in R Markdown
as they are in (for example) [GitHub Flavored Markdown](glossary.html#gfm),
people who have used other dialects may trip over small differences.

This chapter starts by introducing Markdown and publishing workflow,
then shows how to embed code and customize reports.
We close by showing how to publish reports on GitHub and Netlify,
which both offer free hosting for small websites.

## Learning Objectives

- Create a Markdown file that includes headings, links, and external images.
- Compile that file to produce an HTML page.
- Customize the page via its YAML header.
- Add R code chunks to a page.
- Format tabular output programmatically.
- Share common startup code between pages.
- Create and customize parameterized documents.
- Publish pages on GitHub by putting generated HTML in the `docs` directory.
- Publish pages by copying them to Netlify.

## How can I create and preview a simple page?

To begin,
create a file called `first.Rmd` and add the following text to it:

<!-- rmarkdown/first.Rmd -->
```markdown
## Methods {-}

Something *really important*.

An [external link](https://tidynomicon.tech).

[Another link][rstudio]

<!-- link table below -->

[rstudio]: https://rstudio.com
```

This shows several key features of Markdown:

-   A level-1 heading (`h1` in HTML) is put on a line starting with `#`.
    A level-2 heading (`h2`) uses two of these and so on.
-   Putting `{-}` immediately after the heading title suppresses numbering.
    Without this,
    our examples would all be included in this book's table of contents,
    which isn't what we want.
    (This is one of R Markdown's extensions to Markdown.)
-   Paragraphs are separated by blank lines.
-   Text can be put in single asterisks for *italics*
    or double asterisk for **bold**.
-   To create a link,
    put the visible text inside square brackets
    and the URL inside parentheses immediately after it.
    This is the reverse of HTML's order,
    which puts the URL inside the opening `a` tag
    *before* the contained text that is displayed.
-   Links can also be written by putting text inside square brackets
    and an identifier immediately after it,
    also in square brackets.
    Those identifiers can then be associated with links in a table at the bottom of the page.
-   Comments are written as they are in HTML.

Here's what the HTML corresponding to our simple Markdown document looks like:

> ## Methods {-}
> 
> Something *really important*.
> 
> An [external link](https://tidynomicon.tech).
> 
> [Another link][rstudio]
> 
> <!-- link table below -->
> 
> [rstudio]: https://rstudio.com

To preview it,
go to the mini-toolbar at the top of your document in the RStudio IDE
and click "knit":
to call the appropriate function from `knitr`
(or a function from one of the libraries built on top of it for generating books or slides).

```{r knit-button, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The 'knit' Button"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rmarkdown/knit-button.png")
```

## How can I run code and include its output in a page?

If this is all R Markdown could do,
it would be nothing more than an idiosyncratic way to create HTML pages.
What makes it powerful is the ability to include code chunks
that are evaluated as the document is knit,
and whose output is included in the final page.
Put this in a file called `second.Rmd`:

````markdown
Displaying the colors:

`r ''````{r}
colors <- c('red', 'green', 'blue')
colors
```
````

The triple back-quotes mark the start and end of a block of code;
putting `{r}` immediately after the back-quotes at the start
tells `knitr` to run the code
and include its output in the generated page,
which therefore looks like this:

<blockquote>
<p>Displaying the colors:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>colors &lt;- c('red', 'green', 'blue')
colors</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;red&quot;   &quot;green&quot; &quot;blue&quot;</code></pre>
</blockquote>

We can put any code we want inside code blocks.
We don't have to execute it all at once:
the `Code` pulldown in RStudio's main menu offers a variety of ways
to run regions of code.
The IDE also gives us a keyboard shortcut to insert a new code chunk,
so there really is no excuse for not making notes as we go along.

We can control execution and formatting by putting options inside the curly braces
at the start of the code block:

-   `{r label}` gives the chunk a label that we can cross-reference.
    Labels must be unique within documents,
    just like the `id` attributes of HTML elements.
-   `{r include=FALSE}` tells `knitr` to run the code
    but *not* to include either the code or its output in the finished document.
    While the option name is confusing—the code is actually included in processing—this
    is handy when we have setup code that loads libraries or does other things
    that our readers probably don't care about.
-   `{r eval=FALSE}` displays the code but doesn't run it,
    and is often used for tutorials like this one.
-   `{r echo=FALSE}` hides the code but includes the output.
    This is most often used for displaying static images
    as we will see below.

These options can be combined by separating them with commas.
In particular,
it's good style to give every chunk a unique label,
so a document might look like this:

````markdown
# My Thesis {-}

`r ''````{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Load tidyverse but don't display messages.
library(tidyverse)
```

`r ''````{r read-data, message=FALSE}
earthquakes <- read_csv('earthquakes.csv')
```

A profound quotation to set the scene.
And then some analysis:

`r ''````{r calculate-depth-by-magnitude}
depth_by_magnitude <- earthquakes %>%
  mutate(round_mag = round(Magnitude)) %>%
  group_by(round_mag) %>%
  summarize(depth = mean(Depth_Km))
depth_by_magnitude
```

Now let's visualize that:

`r ''````{r plot-depth-by-magnitude}
depth_by_magnitude %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = round_mag, y = depth))
```
````

In order:

-   The document title is a level-1 header with suppressed numbering.
-   The first code chunk is called `setup`
    and neither it nor its output are included in the output page.
-   The second chunk is called `read-data`.
    It is shown in the output,
    but its output is not.
-   There is then a (very) short paragraph.
-   The third code chunk calculates the mean depth by rounded magnitude.
    Both the code and its output are included;
    the output is just R's textual display of the `depth_by_magnitude` table.
-   After an even shorter paragraph,
    there is another named chunk whose output is a plot rather than text.
    `knitr` runs `ggplot2` to create the plot and includes it in the page.

When this page is knit,
the result is:

<blockquote>
<h1>My Thesis</h1>
<pre class="r"><code>earthquakes &lt;- read_csv('earthquakes.csv')</code></pre>
<p>A profound quotation to set the scene. And then some analysis:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>depth_by_magnitude &lt;- earthquakes %&gt;%
  mutate(round_mag = round(Magnitude)) %&gt;%
  group_by(round_mag) %&gt;%
  summarize(depth = mean(Depth_Km))

<pre><code>## # A tibble: 5 x 2

<p>Now let’s visualize that:</p>
